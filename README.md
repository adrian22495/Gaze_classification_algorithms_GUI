# Gaze_classification_algorithms_GUI
An interface to visualize the result of different gaze classification algorithms

#Last changes
1. The gaze data is send it to the NH algorithm splitted into stimuli
2. Partially fixed a bug in NH algorithm. The convolution used to calculate gaze velocity was creating a fake last value.
